              <blockquote><h3>What is mob justice?</h3><p>Say tomorrow morning you are driving to work and a pedestrian suddenly crosses the road. You slam the brake and narrowly miss her. She gets angry and begins shouting at you. Within minutes, a crowd surrounds you and starts beating you up. That is mob justice!

The mob believes you are the wrongdoer. So it act as the jury and the executioner, and takes the law unto itself to mete out instant, violent justice. Mob justice is also called vigilantism.</p></blockquote>

              <blockquote><h3>What is the difference between mob justice and lynching?</h3><p>Often the mob gets so worked up that it ends up killing the perceived wrongdoer. In such situations, the act of the mob is called lynching. The word lynch comes from the American phrase Lynch Laws used to describe punishment without trial.

The phrase emerged in the 1700s following the American Civil War when African Americans were given civil rights. White supremacists resented their former slaves having the same rights as them and went on a violent spree to establish supremacy over African Americans. Today, the word is used to describe extrajudicial executions by a mob to punish an alleged criminal, wrongdoer or to instill fear in the minds of a group of people. Lynching is a form of mob justice where the mob descends to violence and ends up killing the perceived wrongdoer. </p></blockquote>

              <blockquote><h3>Why do people lynch? India specific reasons.</h3><p>Police and judiciary in India are understaffed and lack basic resources.

> There are only 136 police officers for every 100,000 people in India. This is one of the lowest ratios in the world. UN recommends 230 police for every 100,000 people. The problem is further compounded by fact around 24.8% of vacancies of the sanctioned strength are not filled. The ratio is even more skewed in rural areas.

> A Lokniti-CSDS study released on 6 August 2016 found that police is one of least trusted non elected institution in India.

> India has only one judge for every 73,000 people.

> Even when cases reach courts, the legal process can take years to pronounce a verdict. As of April 2016, 20 million cases were pending, two-thirds of which are criminal. 2 million cases have been pending for more than 10 years.

People, especially from the weaker sections and in rural areas, are often left to fend for themselves. For example, after three Muslim youth were lynched in West Bengal’s Durgapur, it was reported that despite frequent complaints to the local police of cow thefts in the village, the residents were asked not to bother the police and to take care of petty matters themselves. Although there is little to suggest why people lynch in India, there is correlation between low levels of trust in police and judiciary and mob-related violence.</p></blockquote>

Those responsible for mob violence often stoke these emotions by organising local meetings, spreading rumours and instructions on WhatsApp or by issuing diktats. Those who organise and manipulate the mob use the cover of the crowd to evade responsibility. </p></blockquote>

              <blockquote><h3>Have cow slaughter related mob justice incidents taken off since 2014? </h3><p>Yes, they have. They account for 15.15% of the cases in our database.

India has experienced varied levels of cow slaughter related violence since 1800s. Cow protection has been a sensitive issue in India and when India gained independence, India’s founding fathers included the prohibition of slaughter of cows and calves and other milch and draught cattle in the country’s Constitution under Article 48 of the  Directive Principles of State Policy.

Since 2014, NDA (BJP led) governments have been elected to in the Center and in 17 out of 29 states with massive majorities. Anti cow slaughter has been on BJP’s manifesto since inception. NDA governments have passed stringent laws against cattle slaughter protection and prioritised their strict enforcement.

As discussed earlier, mobs in India lynch people for anything that they perceive as wrong or illegal.

Today, 99.38% of India's population lives under cow-protection laws. With the BJP’s elevation to state assemblies, local “gau rakshak” or cow protection groups have cropped up across the country leading to a rise of cow protection related mob violence incidents.

We analysed 298 incidents of mob lynching from 2011 till 2017. Off these 87 cases did not mention if the caste and religion of the victims. Of the remaining, 23% were Muslim, 6.3% were Dalit. According to National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data, crimes against Dalits have:

> Dropped by 4% in the first year of N.D.A. (2014-2015). The data for the year 2016 is not available yet.

The National Commission for Minorities (NCM) received 16.5% less complaints from Muslims between 2014-2016 (2858 complaints) compared to 2012-2014 (3424 complaints).</p></blockquote>
