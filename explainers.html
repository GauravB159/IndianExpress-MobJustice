      <h3 class="ui header">What is mob justice?</h3>
      <p>Say tomorrow morning you are driving to work and a pedestrian suddenly crosses the road. You slam the brake and narrowly miss him. He gets angry and starts shouting at you. Within minutes, a crowd surrounds you and starts beating you up. That’s mob justice!</p>
      <p>The mob believes that they have been victimised by you, the wrongdoer. So they act as the jury and the executioner and they take the law unto themselves and mete out instant and, often violent, justice.</p>
      <h3 class="ui header">Why do people lynch?</h3>
      <p>Mob justice is common in societies where citizens do not trust the police and judiciary to do their job and hence believe that the perceived wrongdoer will go scot-free. Hence, the mob decides to take the law in their own hand.</p>
      <h3 class="ui header">Why is it illegal?</h3>
      <p>Such acts violate a person’s right to a fair trial and the right to be innocent until proven guilty granted by both the Constitution of India and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Such acts violate freedoms granted under Article 21 (Freedom of life and liberty) and Article 14 (Equality before law) of the Constitution of India, and Article 3 (Freedom of life and liberty) and Article 10 (Right to a fair trial) under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p>
      <h3 class="ui header">Does it occur only in India?</h3>
      <p>Mob Justice is common in many countries with poor law and order infrastructure. These include South Africa, Bangladesh, Uganda, China, Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana, Brazil, Bolivia, Venezuela, Burundi, etc.</p>
      <h3 class="ui header">Do Indians lynch only for cow vigilantism?</h3>
      <p>Lynchings in India are fairly common. We analysed 298 incidents of mob lynching from 2011 till 2017 and found that people lynch other people for anything that they perceive as wrong or illegal - suspected theft, suspected murder, altercations, inter-religion or inter-caste marriages (honour killing), sexual harassment, witch hunting etc.</p>
      <p>In fact, only 45 of 298 i.e. 15% of the cases were for cow vigilantism.</p>
