        <h3 class="ui header" id="what">1. What is mob justice?</h3>
      <p>Say tomorrow morning you are driving to work and a pedestrian suddenly crosses the road. You slam the brake and narrowly miss him. He gets angry and starts shouting at you. Within minutes, a crowd surrounds you and starts beating you up. That’s mob justice!</p>
      <p>The mob believes that they have been victimised by you, the wrongdoer. So they act as the jury and the executioner and they take the law unto themselves and mete out instant and, often violent, justice.</p>
      <h3 class="ui header" id="why-lynch">2. Why do people lynch?</h3>
      <p>Mob justice is common in societies where citizens do not trust the police and judiciary to do their job and hence believe that the perceived wrongdoer will go scot-free. Hence, the mob decides to take the law in their own hand.</p>
      <h3 class="ui header" id="why-indians-lynch">3. Why do people lynch? India specific reasons.</h3>
      <p>People lynch because they do not have trust that the country’s law and order machinery to give them justice. Specifically, in India:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>India has only 136 police officers for every 100,000 people. This is one of the lowest ratios in the world. UN recommends 230 police for every 100,000 people. The problem is further compounded by fact around 24.8% of vacancies of the sanctioned strength are not filled. The ratio is even more skewed in rural areas.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="ui header" id="illegal">4. Why is it illegal?</h3>
      <p>Such acts violate a person’s right to a fair trial and the right to be innocent until proven guilty granted by both the Constitution of India and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Such acts violate freedoms granted under Article 21 (Freedom of life and liberty) and Article 14 (Equality before law) of the Constitution of India, and Article 3 (Freedom of life and liberty) and Article 10 (Right to a fair trial) under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p>
      <h3 class="ui header" id="only-in-india">5. Does it occur only in India?</h3>
      <p>Mob Justice is common in many countries with poor law and order infrastructure. These include South Africa, Bangladesh, Uganda, China, Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana, Brazil, Bolivia, Venezuela, Burundi, etc.</p>
      <h3 class="ui header" id="lynching-only-for-cow-violence">6. Do Indians lynch only for cow vigilantism?</h3>
      <p>Lynchings in India are fairly common. We analysed 298 incidents of mob lynching from 2011 till 2017 and found that people lynch other people for anything that they perceive as wrong or illegal - suspected theft, suspected murder, altercations, inter-religion or inter-caste marriages (honour killing), sexual harassment, witch hunting etc.</p>
      <p>In fact, only 45 of 298 i.e. 15% of the cases were for cow vigilantism.</p>
      <h3 class="ui header" id="cow-violence-up-since-2014">7. Has cow slaughter related mob justice incidents taken off since 2014? Why?</h3>
      <p>Yes it has. It accounts for 15.15% of the cases in our database. </p>
      <p>India has experienced varied levels of cow slaughter related violence since 1800s. When India gained independence, India’s founding fathers recommends that states prohibit slaughter of cows and calves in Article 48 of the Constitution of India. However, prior to 2014, governments did not pass legislature against cow slaughter and even if legislature existed, did not enforce it.</p>
      <p>Since 2014, citizens have voted in NDA (BJP led) governments in the Center and in 17 out of 29 states with massive majorities. Anti cow slaughter has been on BJP’s manifesto since inception. NDA governments have passed stringent regulation against cattle slaughter protection and decided to strictly enforce it. </p>
      <p>Lynchings in India are fairly common. People lynch other people for anything that they perceive as wrong or illegal. With the anti-cow slaughter movement since 2014, a new wrongdoing got added to list. In response, local “gau rakshak” or cow protection groups cropped up across the country to enforce these laws and this led to the rise of cow slaughter related mob justice incidents.</p>
      <h3 class="ui header" id="why-now">8. Why are we talking about it now?</h3>
      <p>Until 2014, reasons for lynching were fairly apolitical. Mobs lynched people for reasons like suspected theft, suspected murder, altercations, inter-religion or inter-caste marriages (honour killing), sexual harassment, witch hunting, etc. Since 2014, some incidents of lynching (15.15%) are tied to cow slaughter, which is a political issue, discussion about it has risen in the country.</p>
      <h3 class="ui header" id="are-victims-only-dalits-and-muslims">9. Are only Muslims and Dalits target of mob justice? Have crimes against Muslims and Dalits gone up since 2014?</h3>
      <p>Dalits and minorities aren’t the only ones being targeted by the mobs. We analysed 298 incidents of mob lynching from 2011 till 2017. Off these 87 cases did not mention if the caste and religion of the victims. Of the remaining, 23% were Muslim, 6.3% were Dalit.</p>
