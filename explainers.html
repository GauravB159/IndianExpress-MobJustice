        <blockquote><h3>What is mob justice? Why is it illegal?</h3><p>When a mob or a group of people become the law unto themselves and mete out justice on someone perceived as a wrongdoer. The mob acts as the victim, the jury and the executioner. It is an extrajudicial process where the people involved or the mob subvert legal processes for instant and, often violent, justice. A better word to describe such acts is vigilantism.
        Such acts violate a person’s right to a fair trial and the right to be innocent until proven guilty granted by both the Constitution of India and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Such acts violate freedoms granted under Article 21 (Freedom of life and liberty) and Article 14 (Equality before law) of the Constitution of India, and Article 3 (Freedom of life and liberty) and Article 10 (Right to a fair trial) under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p></blockquote>
