         <h3>What is #TheLynched?</h3>
         <p>#TheLynched is a public database of mob-justice related incidents in India. We want to go beyond the existing binaries of religion, hate, politics of cow, etc. and hope to discover indicative insights that can add to our collective understanding of the culture of mob justice in India.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer" id="numerical-analysis">
          <h3>Was the data collected for an exact numerical analysis?</h3>
          <p>No.</p>
          <p>It is not feasible to collect every single incident of lynching across the country. That’s job is best left for the National Crime Records Bureau. The goal is to collect a representative sample of the different type of lynchings across the country. From this sample, we are then trying to draw broad insights to help us better understand the issue.</p>
          <p>We do not intend to give out definitive conclusions or build scorecards in adversarial situations, like the of political killings in Kerala or Hindus versus Muslims.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer" id="why">
          <h3>Why build a database?</h3>
          <p>We, in India, do a bad job of counting incidents of lynch mobs and street justice. The National Crimes Records Bureau, the agency responsible for collecting and analysing crime data in the country, does not record incidents of lynchings. Incident reported by the media is one way to keep track of lynchings in the country. #TheLynched is an attempt to record the stories of those killed and attacked by mobs in India.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer" id="included">
          <h3>Which incidents are included?</h3>
          <p>Spontaneous and relatively immediate acts of retribution, exerting  of private citizens (number of accused were three or more), without consulting the police or justice department, in the name of crime control, social control or out of vengeance.</p>
          <p>We know that we cannot include every single incident hence we have tried to collect as broad a sample that is representative.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer" id="hate-crime">
          <h3>How are we qualifying and quantifying hate crimes?</h3>
          <p>We are defining hate crime as: offenses motivated by hatred against a victim based on her race, religion, sexual orientation, gender, caste,  ethnicity, or national origin. (<a href="https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/bja/162304.pdf" target="_blank">A Policymaker’s Guide to Hate Crimes, Bureau of Justice Assistance</a>)</p>
          <p>To quantify this, we are collecting data related each of the above mentioned reasons for hate crime. <a href="data-dictionary.html">Read more at data collection methodology</a>.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer" id="excluded">
          <h3>Which incidents have not been included?</h3>
          <p>We are not including riots, protests, cases related to naxalism, cases related to insurgency and stone pelting at police in protest.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer" id="data-collection">
          <h3>How did we collect the data?</h3>
          <p>We used MIT Media Cloud to scour through IndianExpress.com from 2010 until 2017 for first reports of mob justice. This gave us a total of 100,000 plus results. Having cast a wide net, we then progressively narrowed down the result set to 200+ unique incidents. Once we have discovered an incident, we try to search follow up articles that talk about this incident from IndianExpress and other major English news sites to build our understanding of the incident. <a href="data-dictionary.html">Read more at data collection methodology</a>.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer" id="difference">
          <h3>How is this data project different from what exists already?</h3>
          <p>Our goal is to go beyond “what happened” and try to understand systemic loopholes that could have prevented what happened.</p>
          <p>Data projects by IndiaSpend and TheWire focused solely on cow vigilantism related incidents, a subset of all lynching. This project tries to collect a representative sample of the different type of lynchings across the country. </p>
          <p>The Hindustan Times’ Hate Tracker focusses only on hate crimes. We have tried to classify incidents based on the type of hate crime i.e. gender, race, ethnicity, religion, caste, etc.</p>
          <p>However, framing the problem of lynchings only from the perspective of hate crime is problematic because:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>The victim of the hate crime can do nothing to change their gender, religion, caste, class, etc.</li>
              <li>The state cannot regulate emotions such as hate and love. However, the state can intervene when hate translates to action (for example, verbal abuse or assault).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Hence, we tried correlating incidents of lynchings against law and order related data points:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Police to Population Ratio in that state</li>
              <li>Benchmarked the Police to Population Ratio per state against recommended ratio by United Nations</li>
              <li>Subordinate Court Judges (lower judiciary) to Population Ratio in that state</li>
              <li>Whether the lynching take place in an urban or rural area</li>
              <li>Which political party was in power when the incident was reported</li>
              <li>Whether the police intervened</li>
              <li>Whether the police intervention prevent a possible death</li>
              <li>And whether prima face, the lynching planned</li>
          </ul>


      </div>
      <div class="answer" id="limitations">
        <h3>What are the limitations of our approach?</h3>
          <p>1. We are building our database based on stories that first reported an incident on the IndianExpress.com and few other English news sites. There are two limitations because of this:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>We will have missed incidents, especially the ones reported in regional local media.</li>
              <li>First reports are often police version of the event and not verified. Moreover, finer details often emerge in later stories.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>2. Some data points collected are not precise</p>
          <ul>
              <li>If not mentioned in the article, we are interpreting social classifications of victims and accused based on names and actions.</li>
              <li>Whether the incident took place in a rural or urban area is based on a cursory Google Search. A better way of doing this would have been to rely on Census data.</li>
              <li>We relied on cursory Google searches to discover if state government police sites have any mention of a state sanctioned Village Defence Forces.</li>
              <li>Based on the first news report, we are trying to infer if the incident was planned or spontaneous. Like in the case of Aklaq, initial stories might not have captured this properly.</li>
          </ul>
