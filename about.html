      <h3 class="ui header">What is The Lynched?</h3>
      <p>The Lynched is a project by the IndianExpress.com — working to count the number of people killed in mob justice related incidents in India from 2010 until 2017, to monitor their demographics and to tell the stories of how they were lynched.</p>
      <p>The database will build on IndianExpress.com reporting to build a more comprehensive record of such incidents. The Lynched is the most thorough public accounting of such incidents in India, but it will operate as an imperfect work in progress – and will be updated by IndianExpress.com as frequently and as promptly as possible.</p>
      <p>Contributions of any information that may improve the quality of our data will be greatly welcomed as we work from a dearth of available information toward better accountability.</p>
      <h3 class="ui header">Why is this necessary? </h3>
      <p>Mob lynching is common in India. Every time such an incident occurs, most media organisations rehash wire copies and print the stories. The sheer volume of everyday crime related stories translates into readers developing mental fatigue or numbness towards such incidents. Readers and journalists alike start ignoring these stories.</p>
      <p>The Indian government has no comprehensive record of the number of people lynched. In fact, National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) recognises the need to collect this data - <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/ncrb-plans-to-create-database-on-lynchings-indin-mob-killings-4742279" target="_blank">http://indianexpress.com/article/india/ncrb-plans-to-create-database-on-lynchings-indin-mob-killings-4742279</a></p>
      <h3 class="ui header">What is included in The Lynched?</h3>
      <p>We are collecting data on "mob justice" and not on mob violence i.e. a group of people taking the law into their own hands and enacting violent justice on an alleged criminal. Other words used to describe mob justice are mob rule, moral policing, jungle justice and instant justice.</p>
      <p>We are searching for news reports in IndianExpress.com and are qualifying incidents as mob justice if both the following conditions are met:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Violence or harassment done by many on few.</li>
        <li>The accused should believe that the victim has committed a crime.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="ui header">What is not included in The Lynched?</h3>
      <p>We are not focusing on mob violence, riots and general 1 on 1 crimes.</p>
      <h3 class="ui header">How we collected the data?</h3>
      <p>
        We used MIT Media Cloud to search for articles in IndianExpress.com from 2010 until 2017 with the keywords "gau rakshak" OR "mob justice" OR lynch* OR vigilant* OR "beaten to death" OR "mob violence" OR "mob rule" or "mob killing" or "mob beats up" OR "stoned to death" OR death or killing.
        <br/><br/>
        It gave us a total of 100,000 plus results. The above keywords got articles from even sections like Entertainment, Sports, Lifestyle, Education, Technology, World, Opinion, etc. Next we used WebScraper.io to enrich the data with section and location. All articles that were not part of the “Cities” and “India” section or had a location that was outside India were removed.
        <br/><br/>
        Following that, we went through the incidents manually.
      </p>
      <h3 class="ui header">What should I do if I have more information on a mob justice incident that is not recorded, or find an error?</h3>
      <p>We welcome all contributions of information that may improve the quality of our data. The Lynched is a comprehensive and ongoing process of verification, as we continue to work from an inaccurate standard toward a more perfect standard. Please pass on your information as soon as possible to <a href="mailto:rparrikh@icfj.news" target="_top">rparrikh@icfj.news</a>.</p>
      <p>Here are <a href="rules.html">the rules that we are following</a> to fill up the data.</p>
