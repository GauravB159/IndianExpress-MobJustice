      <br/>
      <h3 class="ui header">What is The Lynched?</h3>
      <p>The Lynched is a project by the IndianExpress.com. We are collecting data on "mob justice" and not on mob violence i.e. a group of people taking the law into their own hands and enacting violent justice on an alleged criminal. Other words used to describe mob justice are mob rule, moral policing, jungle justice and instant justice.</p>
      <h3 class="ui header">Why is this necessary? </h3>
      <p>Over the last few years, there have been a string of mob justice incidents. Hence, it was important to collect this data. National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) itself is planning to launch their own database on lynching - <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/ncrb-plans-to-create-database-on-lynchings-indin-mob-killings-4742279" target="_blank">http://indianexpress.com/article/india/ncrb-plans-to-create-database-on-lynchings-indin-mob-killings-4742279</a></p>
      <h3 class="ui header">What is included in The Lynched?</h3>
      <p>We are searching for news reports in IndianExpress.com and are qualifying incidents as mob justice if both the following conditions are met:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Violence or harassment done by many on few.</li>
        <li>The accused should believe that the victim has committed a crime.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="ui header">What is not included in The Lynched?</h3>
      <p>We are not focusing on mob violence, riots and general 1 on 1 crimes.</p>
      <h3 class="ui header">How we collected the data?</h3>
      <p>
        We used MIT Media Cloud to search for articles in IndianExpress.com from 2010 until 2017 with the keywords "gau rakshak" OR "mob justice" OR lynch* OR vigilant* OR "beaten to death" OR "mob violence" OR "mob rule" or "mob killing" or "mob beats up" OR "stoned to death" OR death or killing.
        <br/><br/>
        It gave us a total of 100,000 plus results. The above keywords got articles from even sections like Entertainment, Sports, Lifestyle, Education, Technology, World, Opinion, etc. Next we used WebScraper.io to enrich the data with section and location. All articles that were not part of the “Cities” and “India” section or had a location that was outside India were removed.
        <br/><br/>
        Following that, we went through the incidents manually.
      </p>
      <h3 class="ui header">What should I do if I have more information on a mob justice incident that is not recorded, or find an error?</h3>
      <p>We welcome all contributions of information that may improve the quality of our data. The Lynched is a comprehensive and ongoing process of verification, as we continue to work from an inaccurate standard toward a more perfect standard. Please pass on your information as soon as possible to <a href="mailto:rparrikh@icfj.news" target="_top">rparrikh@icfj.news</a>.</p>
